A S$30K funded project to develop an automated options trading program for two semi-retired engineers-turned-traders. The proprietary strategy generates an estimated 20% annually on a 7 figure portfolio.

# Architecture
## Phase 1: Gathering data, calculate intrinsic value of assets
![Architecture](./public/images/architecturePhase1.png)

## Phase 2: Gather top stock tickers from proprietary website ranked based on ROI of options. 
![ArchitectureP2](./public/images/archiPhase2.png)

## Phase 3: Execute trades through IBKR that meet criteria for proprietary columns

## Phase 4: Use ML (NLP) to estimate 3-tier growth rates for companies
For this project, my original plan was to use [FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert), a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial text. It is built by further training the BERT language model in the finance domain, using a large financial corpus and thereby fine-tuning it for financial sentiment classification. 

I then switched to using GPT-4 with strict format restrictions for growth rate estimation with news articles.

## Phase 5: Kelly Criterion for portfolio optimization

## Phase 6: Options Contracts Scanner Engine (OCSE)
![OCSE1](./public/images/OCSE1.png)
![OCSE2](./public/images/OCSE2.png)

## Phase 7: Complete Automation of Research, Live Data Analysis, Trade Execution and Portfolio Management 
QuietQuant is now fully automated, running end-to-end analysis and trading autonomously, maintaining a continuous cycle of evaluation, optimization, and portfolio management. It gathers data, calculates intrinsic values, analyzes sentiment, executes risk-managed trades, with no human bias and intervention.
